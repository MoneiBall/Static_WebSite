<b>RANCHO CORDOVA, Calif.—VSP Global</b> is entering the wearable technology category with the launch of Level,a smart glass that features activity-tracking technology embedded inside the temple of an optical frame. The technology tracks activity via an accompanying smartphone app. As users reach daily step goals they earn points redeemable for a donation of vision care services to people in need.<q>We’re thrilled to bring Level smart glasses to market and offer our members an opportunity to apply their vision care benefits toward the purchase of a meaningful wearable device</q> - said <b>Kate Renwick-Espinosa</b>, president of <b>VSP Vision Care.</b><br><br>

  <p>The basic definitions of bubble types and their size ranges are also presented based on the explanations of different researchers.
   The characterization parameters with state-of-the-art measuring and analysis techniques of <b>Microbubble</b> and <b>Nanobubble Technologies</b> are summarized. Some major applications of these technologies in water-treatment processes are reviewed and briefly discussed. Based on the reviews, various potential areas for research and bubble application gaps in water and wastewater treatment technologies are identified for further study. The article is prepared in such a way that it provides a step-by-step acquaintance to the subject matter with the objective of focusing on the application of microbubbles and nanobubbles in <b>Water-Treatment Technology.</b> </p>

  <p><b>Falcon Heavy</b>, which is now the world’s most powerful rocket, carried a limited-edition <b>Tesla Roadster</b> as its payload, which will travel in an elliptical orbit around the Sun on its way toward Mars. Yes, seriously.

Don’t let the sports car <i>(complete with spacesuit-clad dummy)</i> playing <b>David Bowie’s</b> “Space Oddity” distract you from the real, concrete achievement here, though. In addition to adding to the issue of space junk in a unique way, the car’s trip toward Mars proves that Falcon Heavy is able to carry impressive payloads far beyond Earth.</p>
